To become a good developer you MUST know WHAT and WHEN to copy-paste code and from WHERE to copy-paste from.
Some basic structure of website must be copy-pasted from other sources; like - tables, forms basic structure and then you can modify them. Waha apna dimag lagana jaha innovation ka kaam hai.
Use chat-GPT, Stackoverflow, cheatsheet or any other website to copy-paste code but apna dimag lagana aur usse properly modify karna.

The title of the webpage is used by search engines. Make sure you use correct titles for your webpage so that it is more optimised (SEO).

<img> tag attributes : 
- width="<just mention the number>",        // u MUST give atleast one of them - width or height. Otherwise when page loads, the img will cover the entire page. THIS HELPS IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL! so keep in mind.
- height="<just mention the number>",       // in case u don't know how much width to set, just set the height. 
- alt="<alternate text in case img doesn't load>"
- src="<the link/path of the img file>" 

<table> tag aur uske subordinates - 
<tr> tag ka kaam hai row banana.
<th> tag ka kaam hai heading dena           // inhe 1st row mein use karo mastt. 
<td> tag ka kaam hai data store karna jo display kiya jayega table k cells mein.

ab, 2 attributes hai - colspan, rowspan. Inhe hum <th>, <td> tags mein use kar sakte hai.
colspan = "<value>"     // kitne columns ka jagah lega.
rowspan = "<value>"     // kitne rows ka jagah lega.

we can add captions for our tables. it's easy. Just use the <caption> your content here </caption> inside <table> tag.
There are some semantic tags -
<thead></thead>         // generally, iske andar humare <th> wala content aata hai.
<tbody></tbody>         // humara data 
<tfoot></tfoot>         // aur last ka kuch calculation type agar chahiye raha to
The above mentioned tags don't change the table in anyway. It just helps us in grouping our content better.


Lists
- unordered Lists       // <ul> <li> </li> </ul>    we can change the bullet point design using "type" attribute.
<ul type= "square"> </ul>

- ordered Lists         // <ol> <li> </li> </ol>    we can change the numbering as well using "type" attribute.
<ol type="a">  </ol>    OR      <ol type="I"> </ol>
- definition Lists      // used very less. Just refer to cheatsheet or google for how to use this.

Core web vitals - Google considers this to rank pages.
Suppose you are competing with other websites who are displaying the same content as yours, then your Core Web Vitals are checked by the search engines to rank.
There are 3 aspects -
1. CLS ( Cumulative Layout Shift ) - while the page loads content, how much does the content gets shift? 
A very good precaution will be to set width and height of images. It will definitely minimise the layout shift while the page is being loaded. 
2. LCP ( Largest Contentful Paint ) - if a page is visited, then how much time is being taken to load the largest content/ element of the website? Google considers 2.5 seconds (max) to be good. 
3. FID ( First Input Delay ) - if a user presses on any <input> element, then in how much time is that input being processed? Google considers that within 100 milliseconds, processing should start upon interaction. 

You can checkout more about the above details at web.dev 

SEO - Search Engine Optimization - used by search engines like Google to display info about a website. The better the website has been coded, the more likely it is going to show up in the search results.


Lighthouse - 
The browser has a tab "Lighthouse" in the developer tools.
We can get the values of the 3 core web vitals from here. Lighthouse generates a report which tells what can be improved in the website. It is a really cool tool!


Now, some good SEO practices -
1. The text within your <title> </title> tag must somehow be related to the content of your website. Whenever the page changes, make sure the content of the <title> tag reflects something about the new content.

2. Use <meta name="description" content = "--your content--">. This tag will contain the description that you would want to show up in google search results of your website. Well, search engine may display description from the content of your website in case you don't provide the mentioned tag. It depends on the search engine, it may have some other criteria.

Forms - Super important stuff. Used in lot of places!

attribute - action = "<the url>" 
          - method = "get/post"
There are many <input> tags that we can use within forms. Some of the common attributes are -
1. type = "text/submit/..."     this attribute helps us to tell browser what type of input element we want.
2. name = "<give a name>"       
3. placeholder = "<enter a placeholder text u want to see in the empty input elements>"

Oh haa, we can use a <label></label> tag for a particular input tag. 
To keep track of which which <label> tag is for which <input> tag, it has an attribute - 
for = "<the id_value of input tag>"

eg - 
<label for="username">Username : </label>
<input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="Enter Username">

We should use our particular label-input tags within <div></div>. we will get line breaks too. 
Yes, there is <br> tag, but prefer to use the <div></div> 


Radio buttons - best in cases when we want the user to select only 1 option.
<input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male"> 
<label for="male">Male</label>
<input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
<label for="female">Female</label>

Now, notice that the "name" attribute is SAME. If we don't do this, it won't choose only 1 when we toggle b/w the radio buttons.
notice that when we click on the labels of the radio button, the radio button automatically gets selected. This happens because we set the "id" attribute of <input> tag and "for" attribute of <label> tag properly. 


Checkbox - best in cases when we want the user to select multiple options.
Drop-down list - use <select></select> tag. Within it, we can give many <option></option>


There are some more important attributes for <input> tags
1. required - yeh laga diya to user ko value to enter karna hi padega.
2. autofocus - automatically focus kar deta hai cursor ko iss particular <input> element pe.
3. pattern = "" - we can use regular expressions within this.

Inline elements - jitna jagah chahiye, utna hi space lo. They allow other inline elements to be on the same line as them.
block elements - takes the entire width of the screen for the element. So, the next element always appears on the next line.

Just look up google to know which are block and which are inline elements.

This is set in CSS using the attribute - "display : inline/block"
So, we can change an element to be inline or block element.

===========================================

id - an attibute to uniquely identify an element. Once 1 element gets a particular id value, there can't be another element with the same id on the same page.
The id of an element can help with linking. Suppose u want to navigate to a particular section in a long article website. If you know the id of that section, u can directly type into the url's end #id_value.
It will directly take you to that particular section.


class - we can give multiple class values to 1 element. Just separate them by spaces.
we can give a particular class value to multiple elements.
the class attribute is used to classify certain elements together. Suppose some of the elements on the page need to be of a particular font, some of them need to be in red color, some of them need be in both - particular font and red color. So, we can have 2 different classes and assign the tags accordingly.

    MEDIA HTML

<video></video>
attributes -
1. src = "<the video address/location>"
2. controls - all those controls - play button, volume control, seeker etc.
3. height or width = "<value>"  - no need to say 32px or 54px. Just mention the value.
4. autoplay - automatically starts playing the video when the page loads.
5. loop - plays video again once it ends.
6. muted - mutes the video by default.
7. poster - specifies the image to be displayed before the video starts playing.


<audio></audio>
Similar to <video> tag. Some of the attributes are similar.
1. src = "file path"
2. controls
3. autoplay
4. loop
5. muted
6. preload = "none/metadata/auto"       // make sure to read about it. 

<svg></svg>                             // Refer here - https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/working-with-svg/
we can create high graphics vector images.
it is very similar to <img> tag. 
The svg tag has many attributes. 

Sometimes the svg image are not displayed on the website even if we link them properly using correct src ="" value.
We need to give a declaration in the opening tag of <svg>. ---- Search it on google ---- 

The <video>, <audio>, <svg> tag are inline tags. 



<iframe></iframe> -                     // an inline element.
we can embed another website inside our website.
Best used to embed youtube videos.
Go on YT, Click on Share btn - click on the "Embed" option - you will get the link.

Semantic tags - 
tags which tell the developers / web crawlers / search engines - who i am, what I do or what is my purpose.
these tags help in improving SEO. They help developers in reading and maintaining the code.
even if we don't use semantic tags, websites still work. But, it is advised to use these. Search engines use them.
These tags are not used for styling.  

Refer the image at - https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/html-semantic-tags/ 

some of them are -
header
footer
nav

HTML Entities               // read at CWH HTML page.
These enable us to display those symbols or characters which are reserved in HTML or they aren't on the keyboard.
some of them are -
&lt;  <
&gt;  >
&copy;    copyright symbol
&nbsp;    blank spaces. Jitna chahiye, utni baar use karo. Well, HTML ignore whitespaces when used in the code.


Another fun tag is the <pre></pre>. Hum kuch bhi, kaise bhi likhe na in tags k andar, woh sab kuch waise ka waisa display ho jayega browser mein.
Meaning, all the new lines, whitespaces, tabs etc will be reflected on the website as well. 
But, this tag won't help us in displaying the tags. We have to use entities for that.


There are quotation tags as well. Just google it.

If we need to display code on the website, we have to use the <code></code> tag.
Of course, use the HTML entities for those tag symbols. It is advised to use the <code></code> tag inside the <pre></pre> tag.
<pre>
    <code>
        ...all the code you want to display....
    </code>
</pre>

SUPER TRICK :

                                CSS

HTML ka kaam tha website ka skeleton create karna hai.
CSS ka kaam hai website ko style dena.

selectors - CSS uses these to target different tags of the HTML.
There are various ways to use it.

===========================================
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
===========================================

11 October 2023

Inline CSS - apply the styles directly within the HTML tags.
for eg -
<h1 style = "color: red; background-color: yellow;"> I am coloring this text red with yellow background color.</h1>
We use the style attribute within the opening tag.
Inside it, we give key:value pairs which are the rules of styles. We sepearate them using ;

This is not considered a good practice. 

Internal CSS - Apply styles within the <style></style> tags which is added in the <head></head> tags.
Use the selectors and add the style declarations.

eg -
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
            background-color:yellow;
        }

        .form-content {
            font-size: 15px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

So, whats the difference b/w inline and internal css ?
Well, if you have many <h1></h1> tags and you want to give the same styling to all of them,
if you use inline css, you will grow old and irritated and stop coding. And even if you persevere, in case you need to make changes, you are in for another headache.
if you use internal css, you will just need to write once and keep your calm.


External CSS -
add all the CSS in another file and just link it in the HTML file. Life becomes easy and your HTML code contains HTML code only. You wont have to worry about the CSS in the .html file. 
Add your styles in another file with extension .css

Use cases 
---------
1. try not to use inline css.
2. you may use internal css when your webpage is not very big.
3. when you are working on a production grade website, use External CSS only.

Selectors - these are used to target/find the specific HTML elements that we want to style.
There are different types of CSS selectors. We can use them as per our requirements.

1. Element selector - simply use the opening tag to target that specific HTML element.
eg: Here "div" is the element selector.
<style>
    div {
        background-color: red;
    }
</style>

Drawbacks - all the "div" elements in the HTML file will get targetted.

2. Class selector - use .<class_name> to apply styles.
eg : Suppose an element has "star" as a class.
<style>
    .star {
        color: red;
    }
</style>

Only those tags which have the class "star" will be targetted.


3. ID selector - similar to class selector. We use #<id_name>


4. Child selectors - if we want to target a child tag of another tag, then use this.
suppose there is a <p></p> tag inside a <div></div>. We want to target the <p> tag only.

eg :
div > p {               
    color: red;
    background-color:gold;
}

Ofcourse, this will target all such p tags inside div tag.
NOTE - the <p> has to be directly inside the <div>. If it is nested in some other tag, this selector wont work.

In case you want any <p></p> tag anywhere inside the <div></div> to be selected, then use descendent selector


5. Descendent selector 

eg: div p {
    color: green;
}
matlab, <div> k andar <p> hona chahiye chahe <p> kisi doosre tag k andar kyu na ho.
even if the <div> itself is somewhere inside another tag, it will work.



6. Universal selector - 
* {

}

targets everything.


7. Psuedo selectors 
Suppose I have a link, and after visiting the link, I want the color to change. Psuedo selector helps.

a:visited {
    color: orange;
}

Suppose I want any new link's color to be displayed green initially.
a:link {
    color: green;
}


The moment we are clicking on a link is the time when a link is active.
Suppose I want the background color to be red when the link is active. So, I can use
a:active {
    background-color: red;
}


On Hover
a:hover {
    background-color: yellow;
}


Now, a tricky one.     // Not used a lot. Only the above mentioned selectors are used in 95% of the cases.
Suppose there are <p></p> tags at many places in an HTML document, 
and you have bizzarre ideas and want to change the background-color of only those <p></p> tags who are the first child of their parent.
p:first-child {
    background-color: blue;
}

CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding, Boders

CSS k andar, har content ek BOX hota hai.
And har ek box ke around kuch aur cheeje hote hai - padding, border, margin.

    Margin
        border
            padding
                CONTENT
            padding
        border
    margin

Now, the TOTAL WIDTH of our content comes out to be the sum of the 
width of [ content + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin]
Same goes for TOTAL HEIGHT except for the margin. Just consider top and bottom values.

NOTE : The background-color that we provide to our content will also be present within the padding.

When we give width or height to a specific element, that value is applied ONLY to the content.
It is not the TOTAL WIDTH/HEIGHT.

To make the TOTAL WIDTH/HEIGHT be = the height/width we mention for that particular element, we have add this -

div {               // let's say we are targetting a div tag.
    margin : 5px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 2 px solid green;
    background-color: yellow;
    height: 200px;
    width: 300px;
    box-sizing: border-box;             <----- this is the declaration.
}

The box-sizing: border-box;     this includes our [ content + padding + border].
It does not include the margin.
This changes the definition of height property.



MARGIN COLLAPSE
It states that if margin of 2 elements are overlapping then, whichever element has greater margin value will be considered. 
So, the maximum margin will be applied ONLY ONCE. The smaller value margin will be ignored.

FONTS
------

To change font of any text use
p {
    font-family : Arial, Tahoma, Verdana;
}

if Arial is not available then Tahoma will be used. If Tahoma isn't present then Verdana will be used.

Always put 1 font-family that is available in everyone's machine like - Times New Roman, Arial etc. 
This will help in cases the 1st font isn't available on the user's computer.

There are many other properties for fonts.
font-size, font-weight, font-style etc.
text-decoration : underline;

Use GOOGLE FONTS for different font families.
Always select all the fonts that u want first and then copy the "import" statement content from Google Fonts.
This will help in bringing all the fonts in 1 request.


TEXT DECORATION 
-----------------

text-transform:  <values>               <----- this is one is really good. Comes in use a lot.
text-decoration: 
text-decoration-color: 
text-decoration-style: 
text-decoration-thickness:          // this one helps to increase the thickness of the underline set using text-decoration-style.

text-align: center;                                 <-- highly used.

line-height - the gap between the lines.            <---- pretty useful.
letter-spacing



There are many more properties. Just google for them when you meet a requirement.

CSS Specificity and Cascading
------------------------------

Suppose we apply different styles using different selectors but all of them are targetting the same element.
At that time, CSS uses it's own Cascade algorithm to apply the styles. 
it determines which style to apply among all the different styles.
The Cascade algorithm has 4 different stages -
1. Position and order of appearance - if selector is of same type, then, the last one is considered for styling.
2. Specificity - when type of selector changes, then Specificity is considered. 
                 the order of Specificity is as follows :
                 inline styles > ID selector > class or attribute selector > Element selector > Universal selector.

Always try to use the least specific selector whenever possible. 
This will help you to change styles later on by using a higher specificity selecotr.

3. Origin : the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from. More preference is given to user authored styles.
eg : user agent stylesheet : aka BROWSER.

4. Important - This one is the most powerful. If you write " !important " after any style declaration, it will overwrite all other styles (even the inline styles).


NOTE - We can calculate specificity. There are points given to different type of selectors.
Refer at - https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/css-specificity/ 

To calculate specificity of complex selectors, watch at 14:05 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTcpbPMZlFE
