To become a good developer you MUST know WHAT and WHEN to copy-paste code and from WHERE to copy-paste from.
Some basic structure of website must be copy-pasted from other sources; like - tables, forms basic structure and then you can modify them. Waha apna dimag lagana jaha innovation ka kaam hai.
Use chat-GPT, Stackoverflow, cheatsheet or any other website to copy-paste code but apna dimag lagana aur usse properly modify karna.

The title of the webpage is used by search engines. Make sure you use correct titles for your webpage so that it is more optimised (SEO).

<img> tag attributes : 
- width="<just mention the number>",        // u MUST give atleast one of them - width or height. Otherwise when page loads, the img will cover the entire page. THIS HELPS IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL! so keep in mind.
- height="<just mention the number>",       // in case u don't know how much width to set, just set the height. 
- alt="<alternate text in case img doesn't load>"
- src="<the link/path of the img file>" 

<table> tag aur uske subordinates - 
<tr> tag ka kaam hai row banana.
<th> tag ka kaam hai heading dena           // inhe 1st row mein use karo mastt. 
<td> tag ka kaam hai data store karna jo display kiya jayega table k cells mein.

ab, 2 attributes hai - colspan, rowspan. Inhe hum <th>, <td> tags mein use kar sakte hai.
colspan = "<value>"     // kitne columns ka jagah lega.
rowspan = "<value>"     // kitne rows ka jagah lega.

we can add captions for our tables. it's easy. Just use the <caption> your content here </caption> inside <table> tag.
There are some semantic tags -
<thead></thead>         // generally, iske andar humare <th> wala content aata hai.
<tbody></tbody>         // humara data 
<tfoot></tfoot>         // aur last ka kuch calculation type agar chahiye raha to
The above mentioned tags don't change the table in anyway. It just helps us in grouping our content better.


Lists
- unordered Lists       // <ul> <li> </li> </ul>    we can change the bullet point design using "type" attribute.
<ul type= "square"> </ul>

- ordered Lists         // <ol> <li> </li> </ol>    we can change the numbering as well using "type" attribute.
<ol type="a">  </ol>    OR      <ol type="I"> </ol>
- definition Lists      // used very less. Just refer to cheatsheet or google for how to use this.

Core web vitals - Google considers this to rank pages.
Suppose you are competing with other websites who are displaying the same content as yours, then your Core Web Vitals are checked by the search engines to rank.
There are 3 aspects -
1. CLS ( Cumulative Layout Shift ) - while the page loads content, how much does the content gets shift? 
A very good precaution will be to set width and height of images. It will definitely minimise the layout shift while the page is being loaded. 
2. LCP ( Largest Contentful Paint ) - if a page is visited, then how much time is being taken to load the largest content/ element of the website? Google considers 2.5 seconds (max) to be good. 
3. FID ( First Input Delay ) - if a user presses on any <input> element, then in how much time is that input being processed? Google considers that within 100 milliseconds, processing should start upon interaction. 

You can checkout more about the above details at web.dev 

SEO - Search Engine Optimization - used by search engines like Google to display info about a website. The better the website has been coded, the more likely it is going to show up in the search results.


Lighthouse - 
The browser has a tab "Lighthouse" in the developer tools.
We can get the values of the 3 core web vitals from here. Lighthouse generates a report which tells what can be improved in the website. It is a really cool tool!


Now, some good SEO practices -
1. The text within your <title> </title> tag must somehow be related to the content of your website. Whenever the page changes, make sure the content of the <title> tag reflects something about the new content.

2. Use <meta name="description" content = "--your content--">. This tag will contain the description that you would want to show up in google search results of your website. Well, search engine may display description from the content of your website in case you don't provide the mentioned tag. It depends on the search engine, it may have some other criteria.

Forms - Super important stuff. Used in lot of places!

attribute - action = "<the url>" 
          - method = "get/post"
There are many <input> tags that we can use within forms. Some of the common attributes are -
1. type = "text/submit/..."     this attribute helps us to tell browser what type of input element we want.
2. name = "<give a name>"       
3. placeholder = "<enter a placeholder text u want to see in the empty input elements>"

Oh haa, we can use a <label></label> tag for a particular input tag. 
To keep track of which which <label> tag is for which <input> tag, it has an attribute - 
for = "<the id_value of input tag>"

eg - 
<label for="username">Username : </label>
<input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="Enter Username">

We should use our particular label-input tags within <div></div>. we will get line breaks too. 
Yes, there is <br> tag, but prefer to use the <div></div> 


Radio buttons - best in cases when we want the user to select only 1 option.
<input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male"> 
<label for="male">Male</label>
<input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
<label for="female">Female</label>

Now, notice that the "name" attribute is SAME. If we don't do this, it won't choose only 1 when we toggle b/w the radio buttons.
notice that when we click on the labels of the radio button, the radio button automatically gets selected. This happens because we set the "id" attribute of <input> tag and "for" attribute of <label> tag properly. 


Checkbox - best in cases when we want the user to select multiple options.
Drop-down list - use <select></select> tag. Within it, we can give many <option></option>


There are some more important attributes for <input> tags
1. required - yeh laga diya to user ko value to enter karna hi padega.
2. autofocus - automatically focus kar deta hai cursor ko iss particular <input> element pe.
3. pattern = "" - we can use regular expressions within this.

Inline elements - jitna jagah chahiye, utna hi space lo. They allow other inline elements to be on the same line as them.
block elements - takes the entire width of the screen for the element. So, the next element always appears on the next line.

Just look up google to know which are block and which are inline elements.

This is set in CSS using the attribute - "display : inline/block"
So, we can change an element to be inline or block element.

id - an attibute to uniquely identify an element. Once 1 element gets a particular id value, there can't be another element with the same id on the same page.
The id of an element can help with linking. Suppose u want to navigate to a particular section in a long article website. If you know the id of that section, u can directly type into the url's end #id_value.
It will directly take you to that particular section.


class - we can give multiple class values to 1 element. Just separate them by spaces.
we can give a particular class value to multiple elements.
the class attribute is used to classify certain elements together. Suppose some of the elements on the page need to be of a particular font, some of them need to be in red color, some of them need be in both - particular font and red color. So, we can have 2 different classes and assign the tags accordingly.

    MEDIA HTML

<video></video>
attributes -
1. src = "<the video address/location>"
2. controls - all those controls - play button, volume control, seeker etc.
3. height or width = "<value>"  - no need to say 32px or 54px. Just mention the value.
4. autoplay - automatically starts playing the video when the page loads.
5. loop - plays video again once it ends.
6. muted - mutes the video by default.
7. poster - specifies the image to be displayed before the video starts playing.


<audio></audio>
Similar to <video> tag. Some of the attributes are similar.
1. src = "file path"
2. controls
3. autoplay
4. loop
5. muted
6. preload = "none/metadata/auto"       // make sure to read about it. 

<svg></svg>                             // Refer here - https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/working-with-svg/
we can create high graphics vector images.
it is very similar to <img> tag. 
The svg tag has many attributes. 

Sometimes the svg image are not displayed on the website even if we link them properly using correct src ="" value.
We need to give a declaration in the opening tag of <svg>. ---- Search it on google ---- 

The <video>, <audio>, <svg> tag are inline tags. 



<iframe></iframe> -                     // an inline element.
we can embed another website inside our website.
Best used to embed youtube videos.
Go on YT, Click on Share btn - click on the "Embed" option - you will get the link.

Semantic tags - 
tags which tell the developers / web crawlers / search engines - who i am, what I do or what is my purpose.
these tags help in improving SEO. They help developers in reading and maintaining the code.
even if we don't use semantic tags, websites still work. But, it is advised to use these. Search engines use them.
These tags are not used for styling.  

Refer the image at - https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/html-semantic-tags/ 

some of them are -
header
footer
nav

HTML Entities               // read at CWH HTML page.
These enable us to display those symbols or characters which are reserved in HTML or they aren't on the keyboard.
some of them are -
&lt;  <
&gt;  >
&copy;    copyright symbol
&nbsp;    blank spaces. Jitna chahiye, utni baar use karo. Well, HTML ignore whitespaces when used in the code.


Another fun tag is the <pre></pre>. Hum kuch bhi, kaise bhi likhe na in tags k andar, woh sab kuch waise ka waisa display ho jayega browser mein.
Meaning, all the new lines, whitespaces, tabs etc will be reflected on the website as well. 
But, this tag won't help us in displaying the tags. We have to use entities for that.


There are quotation tags as well. Just google it.

If we need to display code on the website, we have to use the <code></code> tag.
Of course, use the HTML entities for those tag symbols. It is advised to use the <code></code> tag inside the <pre></pre> tag.
<pre>
    <code>
        ...all the code you want to display....
    </code>
</pre>

SUPER TRICK :

Shift + tab     - helps to reduce 1 indent.
